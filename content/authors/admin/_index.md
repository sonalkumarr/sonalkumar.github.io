      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Sonal Kumar is a third year PhD candidate in the Neuroscience and Neurogenetics program at the Jackson Laboratory in collaboration with Tufts University. She is currently investigating the genetic basis of neurodegeneration in a population of laboratory marmosets, as a part of the MARMO-AD consortium working to establish the common marmoset as a near-clinical model of Alzheimer's disease.
